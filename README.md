## Node JS Random Color Generator

When a user enters node index.js in the command line, a block of approximately 31x9 # characters colored with a random color (using hex code, e.g. #ff0000) should be generated.

[x] create const to print the block
[x] find a library for random coloring
[ ] how to figure out to color the block

In addition to node index.js, it should also be able to accept the request for a:

hue (e.g. green or red or blue)
luminosity (e.g. light or dark)
...and then generate random colors that match those choices.

[ ] accept a request from user
[ ] accept 'hue' and 'luminosity' inputs from user
